Game List for PS Now Games

https://github.com/aickletfraid/PSNowGames/blob/master/psnowgamelist3-2.csv

This is a short script for fetching available games on the Playstation Now platform by Sony.
It supports the region: USA and Europe


Necessary modules for the script: requests, html2json, bs4, bs2json, ast
Install using below requirements file

```
pip install -r requirements.txt

```


You can run the "Gamelist PS Now new.ipynb" first and then "US and Europe in one list.ipynb" to get the complete list with Jupyter Notebook.

Otherwise run "usa_and_europe.py" with Python. It has a better database than the first script.
```sh
$ python usa_and_europe.py
```

In both cases a new "psnowgamelist.csv" file will be created with all the games.
